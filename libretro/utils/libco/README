A cooperative multithreading library.

Has native backends for the following CPU
architectures:
* x86
* x86_64 (AMD64)
* ARM
* PowerPC 32/64

Also contains several fallback backends 
in case a native backend is not available 
for your CPU architecture:

* SJLJ
* POSIX ucontext
* Windows Fibers

These fallback backends are not recommended
however for performance reasons.
